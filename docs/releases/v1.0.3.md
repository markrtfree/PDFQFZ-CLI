## PDFQFZ CLI v1.0.3

Release date: 2025-11-06

### Changes
- Allow `--suffix` to be used without `--output`, so in-place stamping no longer throws an error.
- Rebuilt the single-file executable to include this fix and keep sensitive assets out of the package.

### Asset
- `PDFQFZ.CLI-win-x64-1.0.3.zip`

### Upgrade tips
Download the zip and replace the previous version. Existing commands continue to work; in-place stamping now accepts `--suffix ""` when you need an empty suffix.
