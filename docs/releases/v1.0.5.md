## PDFQFZ CLI v1.0.5

Release date: 2025-11-06

### Changes
- Fixed in-place stamping on locked or read-only files by falling back to copy-based replacement and clearing read-only attributes.
- Rebuilt the Windows single-file executable; package still contains only `PDFQFZ.CLI.exe`.

### Asset
- `PDFQFZ.CLI-win-x64-1.0.5.zip`

### Upgrade tips
Download the new zip and replace your previous version. Commands using `--suffix ""` now succeed even if the source PDF is read-only.
